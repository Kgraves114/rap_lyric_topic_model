44858,Daz Dillinger,"      [Featuring Nate Dogg  Snoop Doggy Dogg]   Snoop (Daz):   Yeah  what I'ma do right here is take my time    and dedicating this one to my niggas resting in peace    and my niggas behind the wall.   See you when I get there  you know what I'm saying? (really doe)   So drip with me as I go down memory lane.   Boy it's a loony where the grass is greener    (1 8 7 ain't shit but a misdemeanor).   I've seen a lot of niggas come up, but few niggas done up,   some rest in peace, with their khakis heavy squeezed.   But it's a East Side thang, a hoo ride thang,   ('cause if we bang to the boogie than we boogie to the bang).   I bring you the motherfucking .38,   (just get the MC and the homie Nate).   So we can slide, slide, slipperdy slide,   as I take you on a trip nigga ride (East Side).   Nate (Daz):   Do you remember back on the East Side?   Where all us niggas used to love to ride.   We didn't care what we did,   time was nothing to us we were just kids.   Times are different now, but you still get stuck,   I'm not a kid no more, I just don't give a fuck.   So if you're thinking about coming and stepping to me,   keep this in mind: I'm a motherfucking O.G.   Snoop:   Lets speed the clock up and pass some time,   June 17th, 1979.   That's my first time being arrested,   I know I did the crime, but I ain't going to confess to this shit.   I learned than from the G's,   a G is an overseer, the overseer sees.   More than you do 'cause he gets experienced,   and besides I'm just a juvenile delinquent.   So I was gone, and I'm on my way home,   my momma's going to get me, and I flee with (???).   She puts a jacket on my back and hands me a comb,   We stop and frosty freeze for a couple snowcones.   She telling me that I didn't need to do what I done,   she said: ""playing football should be your only fun son"".   I'm like ""allright"" so we enter the house,   come up to the door and pops fired to the mouth.   I couldn't do nothing but cry like a bitch,   I looked at my momma and said: ""damn, why you snitch?""   They put me on punishment but that didn't work,   now wearing khakis, wallabees, and a T-shirt.   And throwing up the neighborhood gang sides,   I do my first robbery and now I gotta do time.   Nate:   My homie told me one day he had a jack move,   he said: ""come on Nate Dogg, it'll be smooth"".   I agreed and said ""come on, let's go and jack them fools"",   next day we were draped in the county blues.   I went and did a little time in the bucket see (seventeen years),   saying to myself ""I'll never fuck with that nigga again"".   'fore I'm locked down I learned to be   what I am now and that's a motherfucking O.G.   Original gangsta   Daz:   I grew up in the city as a chap, faced the trials,   never smiled, became a gangster in the meanwhile.   You'd find me swearing and lying, trying to be an O.G.,   beating the shit out of niggas for guess, some Hillfigers.   The man behind the trigger, committing robberies,   with the homies, no one could stop, nobody knew me.   Breaking niggas for showing, sucker niggas better know me,   because we ain't letting the bullshit slide no more.   Do your wear nigga and kick in your front door,   to let you know we can't take no more.   Feeling revenge, killing enemies, family and friends,   and let you pay the cost for my homie's life, it's lost.   Toss a coin in the air, run my fingers through my hair,   and ask myself: ""who the fuck should I really fear?"".   I ran around with the best killers,   thug criminals and drug dealers.   Blasting niggas if they come near us,   (???) with evil spirits, no one could help us if we could.   Knock on wood for good luck,   serve every nigga in your hood with a buck, now you've been struck.   Stood gangsta in a static gangsta mack,   a grown child laying niggas the fuck down.   Nate (Daz):   Original gangsta (original gangsta),   coming from Long Beach (the town by the sea where niggas know me).   Coming from the East Side...   You're fucking with The Pound, oh nigga please,   see-O-B.'s can't see the D-O-double G's, [O.G.'s... repeat 5 times]   shout outs to my nigga Mr. D-A-Z,   shout outs to my nigga Mr. Warren G,   shout outs to my nigga S-N-double O-P,   shout outs to my niggas see, Style and me.   Snoop (Nate):   Yeah, straight up, based on a true story.   you know what I'm saying? It's a G thang baby (original gangsta)   You trick ass bitch!    ",O.G.,West

We haven't spotted them yet But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity  A 100 miles and runnin Mc Ren, I hold the gun and You want me to kill a muther f**ker and it's done in. Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct - Is one of the main reasons I don't give a f**k. Chances are usually not good Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood. And getting' jacked by the you-know-who. When in a black and white the capacity is two. We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers. Now wearin'  my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, muther f**kers. They're out to take our heads  for what we said in the past. Point blank - they can kizz my black azz. I  didn't stutter when I said ""f**k tha police"". Cause it's hard for a nigga to  get peace. Now it's broken and can't be fixed. Cause police and little black  niggas don't mix so  Now I'm creepin' Through the fall. Runnin' Like a team. Well, see, I might have slayed y'all. So  for now pack the gun and Hold it in the air. ?cause mc ren has a 100 miles of  runnin  ""Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run."" ""FBI sources tell us that the four are headed"" ""100 miles to their home base, Compton.""  Lend me a muther f**kin' ear. So I can tell you why...

And Dre is back from the c-p-t. Droppin' some  shit that's d-o-p-e. So f**k the p-o-l-i-c-e! And any muther f**ker that  disagrees. Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass. 'cause I'm a nigga known for  havin' a notorious past. My mind was slick - my temper was too quick. Now the  FBI's all over my dick.  Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock. That's  when the e jumped off the startin' block. A 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a  long stretch. A little sprintin' muther f**ker that they won't catch. Yeah,  back to Compton again. Yo, it's either that or the federal pen. 'cause niggas  been runnin' since beginning of time. Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my  muther f**kin' mind. Runnin' like I just don't care. Compton's 50 miles but,  yo, I'm ma get there. Archin my back and on a straight rough.

Show me on the news but I hate to be abused. I know it was a set-up. So now I'm gonna get up. Even if the FBI wants me to shut up. But I've got 10 000 niggas strong. They got everybody singin' my ""f**k tha police"" song. And while they treat my group like dirt, Their whole f**kin' family is wearin' our t-shirts. So I'mma run til I can't run no more.

On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name To make it interesting it's me, peep game I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad And two step-brothers who treated me bad I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors And I was like an errand boy running to the stores My brothers, they used to boast and brag: ""We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!"" And even worse than that, to make me feel low They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows Girls used to say, ""Snoop, you're so cute But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit"" Well, one day, up the Avenue There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew He said ah, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all! The princess is having a royal ball If you can rap, also dress fresh You might win a date with the sweet princess"" Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad I said, ""Step-dad, may I?"" And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied (Cinderfella!) My brothers were going, they were getting down Even Pops was going for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!) They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted ""We can and you can't,"" is what they taunted  They all stood there, laughin in my face And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!""

My name is Herb I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word! Now I've came here with the main purpose Of granting you your fondest wish"" I said, ""Herb, my man, just make me fresh And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest"" With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit On my feet was some white tube socks And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock I showed him my sack, and don't you know With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe Once again his hands began to flow Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!)

I left the stage, girls came in flocks The bitch was swinging from the hard knocks I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock No time to waste, I broke out in haste The princess followed in a futile chase A quick steady pace is what I kept Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps For the six-fo' I continued my stride About this time I heard gong five I was down the block when I heard gong eight And the princess screamed out, ""Wait!

Nah, it couldn't be"" They kept asking me if I did my chores My butt was saved by a knock at the door ""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked ""The princess,"" this sweet voice remarked She said she was looking for a certain man Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand The family ran around with their heads in the air Bringin her shoes from everywhere She just shook her head, a nod of relief And said, ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief"" I ran in the room and got my shoe And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?""

women, and children  Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in  The projects, lifeless like a Vietnam vet  Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest  Crooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble  Streets are like a jungle, can't let my cipher crumble  Vivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge  They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars  I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing  Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting  It's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll  Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold  Not a role model, I walk a hard role to follow  I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels  The gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole  Mentally they fold, and they eventually sold  Their life and times, deadly like the virus design  But too, minute to dilute, the science is mine   You can't party your life away  Drink your life away  Smoke your life away  Fuck your life away  Dream your life away  Scheme your life away  Cause your seeds grow up the same way   A voice cries from the wilderness of the North  A representation of the families that lost one  All victims of incarceration  Or other divisions of the family structure  Youths are injected with serums that leads  To skin irritations, babies being born with  Disfigurations, experimentations  On their faces there bear world relations  Of mothers that carry the pain  Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail  Big brothers been slain from hails of gun fire  It lightly begins to rain screams of terror  Are hidden by the passing trains  This can't be little Shane, his uncle cried  As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane  Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this  Bitter sickness, and left us to witness   Yeah, yo  Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days  Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise  Tree of life, more precious than Wu is golden game  The wise self flourish inherit, Halls of Fame  Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison  While we die hard living people whine about religion, vision  Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing  It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen  Zero process, progress, become the hunted  America's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it  Some love the speed, some satisfy a need  Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed  The stronger speed, someone die, someone bleed  One flew astray, and then caught my little seed  Can it be, the ice have us trifle life, made me grab the knife  The righteous man would be within these stripes pipes  Take in my energy, breath and know the rest  Cause the good die young and the hard die best   You can't party your

Cause your seeds grow up the same way   Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants  While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances  Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick  The whole projects is trapped in stench  You either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs  Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out  Ninety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking  Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking  New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, better cage  Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays  Inside my lab, I'm going mad  Took two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag  The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods  The whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs  Or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn  Early light, why is sons fighting for the stripe   As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home  Mama say, take your time young man and build your own  Don't wind up like your old dad  Still searching for them glory days he never had  So many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings  The cash rule everything now, we going down  These babies looking up to us, it's up to us  The Million Man March MC's, get on the bus  But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate  Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate  No longer, brothers, we unstable  Like

You say that like that means somethin' to me You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin' time For you to be comin' home talkin' that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga) We been gettin' along fine just without you Me, my brother, and my mother So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. FUCK YOU!  Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night Please send me a pops before puberty The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity Moms always work, I barely see her I'm startin' to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her It's a wonder they don't understand kids today So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way And I hope that he answers me I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family A different father every weekend Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends I'm gettin' sick of all the friendships As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick How can I be a man if there's no role model? Strivin' to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle I'm so sorry  I'm so sorry For all this time (I'm so sorry) For all this time For all this time (don't lie) I'm so sorry For all this time (so, sorry) For all this time For all this time, so sorry baby!  Moms had to entertain many men; Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again. I'm gettin' a bit older and I'm startin' to be a bother; Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin' like my father Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough; Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities Instead of takin' care of me, he'd rather live lavishly That's why I'll never be a father; Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother (That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles Said I was an only child) Look at mama's lonely smile! It's hard for a son to see his mother cry She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys I'm so sorry  I'm so sorry For all this time (I'm so sorry) For all this time For all this time (don't lie) I'm so sorry For all this time (so, sorry) For all this time For all this time, so sorry baby!  Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show And ohh, I guess ya didn't know That I would grow to be so strong Lookin' kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong? Where was the money that you said, you would send me Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly Ask about school and my welfare But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin', Jack! You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart So don't even start with that ""Born to be a father"" shit Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me You're so sorry  I'm so sorry For all this time (I'm so sorry) For all this time For all this time (don't lie) I'm so sorry For all this time (so, sorry) For all this time For all this time, so sorry baby!  I never meant to leave but I was wanted Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger; If I wanted to to keep you breathin', had to be out of range-a Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast But livin' slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong It took a little longer than I thought I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand All I ever wanted was for you to be a man And grow to be the titan you was meant to be Keep the war fightin' by the writings that you sent to me I'm so sorry  I'm so sorry For all this time (I'm so sorry) For all this time For all this time (don't lie) I'm so sorry For all this time (so, sorry) For all this time For all this time, so sorry baby!",Papa'z Song,West

Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day And running from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside And even as a crack fiend, mama You always was a black queen, mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it There's no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  Lady Don't ya know we love ya?

Sweet lady And dear mama Place no one above ya, sweet lady You are appreciated Don't ya know we love ya?  Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate, how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if ya hold on It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  Lady Don't ya know we love ya?

A little grown boy a mind with a tortured soul Addicted to a life of crime at no time for growin' stage He learned his values on the streets at an early age Watch for police don't come home 'Cause Mama's actin' crazy at the hospital 'Bout to have another baby Like the rose from a concrete Grown within' blessed with twins How the hell can Mama raise three men So we began a closest family Such insanity a happy home For one act inhumanity Plus Mama said, ""The seed was corrupted"" Used the rubber belly Beggin' us to breathe if she love us Now Mama sits quiet sippin' peppermint Schnapps Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops How could Mama bring a thug like me in this world?

I walk away I'm tryin' to hold the world up on top me Probably be an innocent man Still I'm the victim of a curse What could be worse? Nothin' but pain Since my birth taught me functions at the pen 'Cause everybody's in payin' back society I'm guilty of a life of sin I watched the drama occur My eyes blurred 'fore I jet it I wonder why we all have to die for we get it Though we shed tears So many peers I done buried Worried and scared Knowin' I'm a see the cemetery Must be prepared in this cold world No one cares No it ain't fair But we all there And do our share In this land of underhanded schemes and plans Vivid dreams of a nigga havin' G's in hand Mama told me not to be a punk Fuck what you talkin' about coward?

Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day And running from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside And even as a crack fiend, mama You always was a black queen, mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man (I know it ain't easy) You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it There's no way I can pay you back But the plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  Dear mama Don't you know I love you? Dear mama Place no one above you (Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you Although my shadow's gone I will never leave you  Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along I was looking for a father he was gone I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hanging I needed money of my own so I started slanging I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks It feels good putting money in your mailbox I love paying rent when the rent's due I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you 'Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone because you cared for me And I could see you coming home after work late You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate Ya just working with the scraps you was given And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving But now the road got rough, you're alone You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  Dear mama Don't you know I love you? Dear mama Place no one above you  (Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you Although my shadow's gone I will never leave you  Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate, how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if ya hold on It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back But my plan is to show you that I understand You are appreciated  Dear mama Don't you know I love you?

But Precious was a ghetto girl Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus  But lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers Seein' visions of people smokin' and n****z catchin' vapors Got his man from around the corner, we'll call him 'Lil Mo Been in so many reform schools, they had to let him go  Here's where the plot thickens They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin' They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin' Somebody's gonna die tonight  Still no one's knowin', so they kept goin' Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars, will they survive?
